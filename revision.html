                    <p>~ 2 December 2024: Yes, I was really this bad just 4 months ago. Once I'd been through 
                        the modules to set up VS code and download the course content I spent a few days 
                        learning to create the most basic html elements.</p></li>

                <li><a href="./simple-ones/html-intermediate.html">Intermediate HTML (lists, nesting, indentation, anchors, images)</a>
                    <p>~ 9 December 2024: I sailed through the bare basics really quickly and started the intermediate level.</p></li>

                <li><a href = "./simple-ones/css-intro.html">Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                    <p>~ 23 December 2024: I learnt how the very first websites lacked styling, and how styling was introduced.</p></li>

                    <p>circa 27 March 2025: My first full website using JS and DOM to simulate 
                        dice rolling and update the website with a result.</p></li>
