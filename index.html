        <h1>Studying Full Stack Development</h1>
        
        <h6>21 April 2025</h6>

        <p>In January 2024 I had never really paid any attention to how websites worked - I was a typical user of 
            web browsers, email, a consumer of news, and an occasional online shopper. I had basically heard of 
            HTML files at some point in ancient history and that was my sum total of technical knowledge.</p>
            
        <p>All this changed when I decided to pursue a new career after nearly 25 years in the construction sector. 
            I initially started with Udemy courses for Python, PostgreSQL, and C#. My existing mathematics and 
            engineering skills were obviously helpful, but I didn't really understand how things fitted 
            together and I found myself growing frustrated. </p>

        <p>Then in December 2025 I discovered Angela Yu's "Full Stack Development" course on Udemy and I finally 
            started feeling like I was really making progress. It's been an exciting and rewarding 4 months. 
            As at Easter 2025 I am nearly finished with the front-end modules and before starting the back-end work 
            I thought it might be good revision to repeat some of the assignments and upload them to my Github space.</p>

        <p>I'm posting everything in it's rawest, ugliest state to remind me how far I've come.</p>
        
        <p>I'll also link my keystone projects, and some of Angela's useful or cool websites.</p>

        <p>One day I'll spend some time making this page look good, or I'll incorporate it into a real portfolio, 
            but for now it is purely serving as a revision tool for me.</p>
